# 🧠 Emotion Classifier App

This is a **Streamlit-based web app** that classifies the emotions embedded in user-input text. It leverages a deep learning model built with **TensorFlow** to predict emotions such as **anger, fear, joy, love, neutral, sadness, and surprise**. The app provides the predicted emotion with its confidence level and displays a probability chart.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **User Input Text**: Enter any text to detect the emotion behind it.
- **Emotion Classification**: The model predicts one of seven emotions: anger, fear, joy, love, neutral, sadness, or surprise.
- **Confidence Level**: Displays the confidence level of the prediction.
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Shows the probability of all emotions in a horizontal bar chart.
  
## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework used to build the emotion classifier model.
- **Streamlit**: Python library used to create the web interface.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the probabilities of the emotions.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

## 📜 Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/emotion-classifier-app.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the app**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4. **Interact**: Enter any text to predict the emotion and view the probability chart.

## 📝 Model Summary

```bash
Model: "functional_2"
...
Total params: 542,343 (2.07 MB)
Trainable params: 542,087 (2.07 MB)
Non-trainable params: 256 (1.00 KB)
```

The model consists of two **Input Layers** followed by **Embedding** and **SpatialDropout1D** layers. The processed text features are passed through **Conv1D**, **BatchNormalization**, and **GlobalMaxPooling1D** layers. The outputs are concatenated and passed through **Dense** and **Dropout** layers, ultimately classifying into one of the seven emotions.

## 🚀 App Overview

### 1. Input Text
You can input your text using the text area provided in the app.

```python
input_text = st.text_area("Type your text here:", height=100)
```

### 2. Prediction Output

When you hit the "Submit" button, the model processes the text and provides:
- **Predicted Emotion**
- **Confidence Level**
- **Prediction Probability Chart**

```python
predicted_emotion_index = np.argmax(predictions)
predicted_emotion = emotion_labels[predicted_emotion_index]
confidence = np.max(predictions)
```

### 3. Visualization

A horizontal bar chart is generated, displaying the prediction probabilities for each emotion.

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 3))
ax.barh(emotion_labels, predictions[0], color=['#FF9999', '#66B3FF', '#99FF99', '#FFCC99', '#FFD700', '#D3D3D3', '#FFB6C1'])
```

## 🔮 Sample Output

```bash
Original Text: "I am extremely happy today!"
Prediction: Joy
Confidence Level: 0.93
```

## 📊 Visualization Breakdown

The app visualizes the prediction results using a bar chart. Each bar represents the model’s confidence for each emotion class. The bar for the predicted emotion is the highest, indicating the highest probability.

- The bars are color-coded for better readability.
- Probability values are displayed next to each bar.
